### Predictive models in Machine Learning

#### _Telco Customer Churn Prediction using DecisionTree model_

Attracted by a better offer, better customer service, companies face loss of customers.  
By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, businesses can develop strategies to reduce churn and retain their customers.

In this project, I build a predictive model using Decision Tree Classifier to predict the abandonment rate of each customer for a Telco provider.

##### Why they leave?

***Attitude of support person*** and ***better technical offer from a competitor*** are two of the most common reasons for customers to leave.

##### When they leave?

***MORE THAN A HALF*** of new customers leave company within only a couple of month. First 24-26 months are extremely important to gain trust.

##### Is there any correlation between churn rate and contract type?

The longer the contract term - the least stressful it is to renew it every time, the happier the customer.
